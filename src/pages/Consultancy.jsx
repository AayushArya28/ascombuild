                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Pre-damage rehabilitation/strengthening are known as retrofitting while post-damage is called repairing. External pre-stressing of concrete girders in longitudinal and vertical directions can be successfully adopted as a strengthening measure. Vertical pre-stressing may be adopted to prevent separation of deck slabs which are generally cast-in-situ over pre-cast girders.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Longitudinal pre-stressing may be adopted to strengthen the girder and to increase its flexural strength. Longitudinal pre-stressing may be resorted to in cases where girders are required to carry increased loads or the existing reinforcement/pre-stressed cables have deteriorated.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        External pre-stressing using techniques such as external bonding of steel plates and fibre wrap is very popular to increase the shear and flexural capacity of girder. Strengthening scheme should achieve 'Compatibility' and 'Continuity' in the structural behavior between original and repaired structure which can be crystal clear by software.
